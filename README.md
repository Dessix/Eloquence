Eloquence
=========

An experimental Botnet Control System being created in an attempt to research botnet functionality academically while discovering problems their developers encounter during the creation of a botnet.
This project is an SRA 221 Term Project at Penn State University's Altoona Campus.

Preparation
===========

To utilize the project, you must install its dependencies into /third_party.
These dependencies consist of Lua 5.2, Luabind 0.9.1, and Boost 1.51.0.


Notice
===========

This project has been "completed" as far as the class was concerned, and were I to rewrite it in the future, I would consider C++/LibUV, NodeJS, Luvit, or Scala for the rewrite, or at least provide a stronger foundation by clearing the stream socket bindings of edge cases. I would also consider removing the dependencies for simplicity of build, because Boost-build is genuinely unpleasant to use.
