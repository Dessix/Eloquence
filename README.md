Eloquence
=========

An experimental Botnet Control System attempting to research botnet functionality academically.
This project is an SRA 221 Term Project at Penn State University's Altoona Campus.

Preparation
===========

To utilize the project, you must install its dependencies into /third_party.
These dependencies consist of Lua 5.2, Luabind 0.9.1, and Boost 1.51.0.
A prepared package of these libraries can be downloaded from DSTech's D6 Gaming webserver [here](http://D6Gaming.net/downloads/pkg/Eloquence_Third_Party.zip).
Extract this package so that third_party resides in the same directory as README.md.


Notice: This project has been "completed" as far as the class was concerned, and were I to rewrite it in the future, I would consider C++/LibUV, NodeJS, Luvit, or Scala for the rewrite, or at least provide a stronger foundation by clearing the stream socket bindings of edge cases.
